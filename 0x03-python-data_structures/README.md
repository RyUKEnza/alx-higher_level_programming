# 0x03 Python Data Structures

Welcome to the 0x03 Python Data Structures project! 🐍 In this project, we'll explore various aspects of Python's data structures, including lists, tuples, and sequences. By the end of this project, you'll understand why Python programming is awesome and how to effectively use its powerful data structures.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you'll be able to:

🚀 Explain why Python programming is awesome  
📝 Understand lists and how to use them  
🔗 Differentiate between strings and lists  
🔍 Use common methods of lists  
📚 Utilize lists as stacks and queues  
🔄 Implement list comprehensions  
🍇 Understand tuples and their usage  
🤔 Know when to use tuples versus lists  
📦 Implement tuple packing and sequence unpacking  
🗑️ Use the `del` statement effectively  

## Requirements
### Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- Use pycodestyle (version 2.8.*) for code style
- End all files with a new line
- Start all files with `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Include a README.md file at the root of the project folder
- Ensure all files are executable
- Length of files will be tested using `wc`
  
### C
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
